/**
 * this is a bad wrapper function because its not follow structured concurrency like "addRepeatingJob"
 * function in flow and both of them aren't suspend function
 *
 *  It doesnâ€™t respect the calling context and can be dangerous to use inside other coroutines
 *  It also will NOT get canceled when you call job.cancel() same as "addRepeatingJob"
 *  This can lead to very subtle bugs in your app which are really difficult to debug.
